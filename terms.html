                    By entering, dining at, or placing an order with Wine & Dine, the guest agrees to
                    comply with and be bound by all terms and conditions stated herein. These terms apply to all
                    customers,
                    visitors, and patrons without exception. The restaurant reserves the right to amend, modify, or
                    update
                    these terms at any time without prior notice. It is the responsibility of the customer to review the
                    terms periodically. Failure to comply with restaurant policies may result in refusal of service or
                    removal from the premises. All services are provided at the sole discretion of the management. The
                    management’s decision in all matters shall be final and binding. These terms apply to dine-in,
                    takeaway,
                    delivery, and private events unless otherwise stated. Any promotional offers are subject to
                    additional

                    Reservations at Wine & Dine are subject to availability and confirmation by the restaurant.
                    The management reserves the right to allocate seating based on operational requirements and table
                    size availability. Reserved tables will be held for a maximum of 15 minutes beyond the confirmed
                    reservation time, after which the reservation may be canceled. Walk-in guests are seated on a
                    first-come, first-served basis. Special seating requests will be considered but are not guaranteed.
                    Large group reservations may require advance booking and a confirmation deposit. The restaurant
                    reserves the right to rearrange seating arrangements in case of emergencies or unforeseen
                    circumstances. Delays due to guest lateness will not entitle guests to compensation or priority
                    seating.

                    All food and beverage items are prepared in accordance with applicable food safety and hygiene
                    standards. Menu descriptions are indicative, and actual presentation may vary. Availability of

                    strictly in accordance with local laws, and valid age proof may be required. The restaurant reserves
                    the right to refuse alcohol service to intoxicated guests or those unable to provide valid
                    identification. Outside food or beverages are not permitted unless explicitly approved by
                    management. Prices listed are subject to change without prior notice. The management shall not be
                    responsible for allergic reactions unless informed in advance in writing.

                    must be reported immediately before payment is completed. Once payment is processed, disputes will
                    not be entertained. Split billing may be accommodated at the discretion of the restaurant. Failure
                    to make timely payment may result in legal action as per applicable laws.

                    Cancellations for confirmed reservations must be communicated within the stipulated time provided
                    during booking. Failure to cancel within the permitted timeframe may result in forfeiture of any
                    advance payment or deposit. No-shows for reservations may be charged a cancellation fee at the
                    discretion of management. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed through the original mode of
                    payment and may take several working days. The restaurant reserves the right to deny refunds in
                    cases of misuse, violation of terms, or false claims. Event bookings and special menus may have
                    separate cancellation and refund policies communicated at the time of booking

                    The management reserves the right to refuse service or ask guests to leave the premises without
                    refund in such cases. Damage to restaurant property caused intentionally or negligently by guests
                    will be charged accordingly. Smoking is permitted only in designated areas as per law. Loud,
                    indecent, or unlawful behavior is strictly prohibited. The restaurant is a family-friendly
                    establishment, and decorum must be maintained at all times.
